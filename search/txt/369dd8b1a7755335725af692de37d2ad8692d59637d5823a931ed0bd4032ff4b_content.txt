                            financial services to users through smart contracts.
                            Existing DeFi projects aim to provide higher
                            annualized earnings for specific currencies.About Binance DeFi StakingThere's a relatively high threshold for users of
                            DeFi products. Binance DeFi Staking acts on behalf
                            of users to participate in certain DeFi products,
                            obtains and distributes realized earnings, and helps
                            users to participate in DeFi products with a single
                            click.What are the advantages of DeFi Staking?1. Easy to use: You don't need to manage private
                            keys, acquire resources, make trades, or perform
                            other complicated tasks to participate in DeFi
                            Staking. Binance's one-stop service allows users to
                            obtain generous online rewards without keeping an
                            on-chain wallet. 2. No gas fee: Binance Staking
                            deposits users’ funds into smart contracts on users’
                            behalf, saving users on-chain gas fees.Does Binance bear the losses if an on-chain
                              contract is attacked during DeFi Staking?No. Binance only acts as a platform to showcase
                            projects and provide users with related services,
                            such as accessing funds on behalf of the user and
                            distributing earnings, etc. Binance does not bear
                            any liability for losses incurred as a result of
                            on-chain contract security.After I participate in DeFi Staking, how is the
                              earnings cycle calculated?Once funds are successfully allocated to DeFi
                            Staking, earnings are calculated beginning at 00:00
                            (UTC) the following day. The minimum earnings
                            calculation period is one day; earnings for a period
                            of less than one day will not be included in the
                            earnings distribution.How long do I need to lock-up my funds to
                              participate in Defi Staking?Currently, the lock-up period for regular products
                            is 1 day. Funds will be unlocked and returned to
                            your account on T + 1. However, as we add support
                            for more types of products, the lock-up periods will
                            vary. Lock-up periods for different products will be
                            specified in the information on the product
                            interface.If I redeem early, can I earn part of the
                              interest?Early redemption will unfortunately deduct all
                            interest based income. This is because assets
                            pledged to participate are locked in the
                            smart-contract on-chain, and the redemption
                            operation requires a more complicated manual
                            operation to initiate and includes certain
                            blockchain transfer fees. Please choose the
                            appropriate lock-up time when subscribing to DeFi
                            Staking products.Why is the principal reduced for early redemption?There is no principal penalty mechanism for early
                            redemption, and the reduction of the principal is
                            done to deduct the interest that has been
                            distributed.Example: User A subscribes for a 7-day
                            wealth management products utilizing BNB at 21:00 PM
                            on the 9th. The income will be calculated at 8:00 AM
                            on the 10th, and the spot wallet will receive the
                            previous days lock-up income after 8:00 AM on the
                            11th; Users who redeem in advance at 16:00 PM on the
                            12th will deduct the two-day paid income from the
                            principal; therefore reducing the principal payout
                            amount.How long does it take to redeem?Redemption requires 1 day to unlock. This is because
                            users' staked assets are used to participate in the
                            on-chain smart contract. Redemption and distribution
                            also take a certain period of time to fufill. For
                            example, user A redeemed a BNB based DeFi Staking at
                            21:00 on September 9th with an unlock period of 24
                            hours. The unlock period will begin at 8:00 AM (UTC)
                            on September 10th, and end at 8:00 AM on September
                            11th. Therefore, the principal can be received by
                            the user at the earliest on the morning of the 11th.
                            Before investing in DeFi products, please consider
                            the limitation of the unlock period.What cryptocurrencies are supported?There are more than 60+ cryptocurrencies that you
                            can use in Binance Defi Staking. You can choose from
                            dozens of digital assets likeBitcoin,Ethereum, and stablecoins.My staked product has expired and automatically
                              restaked, when does the interest accrue and pay
                              out?The day you staked product expires, it will
                            automatically stake to its previous duration product
                            and accrue interest immediately. For example, if
                            your staking expired on Mar 1st, it will auto-stake
                            on Mar 1st, and the interest will start to accrue on
                            the same day. It will be distributed to you on Mar
                            2nd.Can I choose early redemption after auto-staking?Yes, you can choose to redeem in advance. After
                            choosing early redemption, the principal will be
                            returned to the spot account, and the distributed
                            interest will be deducted from the refunded
                            principal. Due to different global time zones, it
                            takes 48-72 hours to receive the tokens.View MoreCommunityEnglishEnglishالعربيةالعربية (البحرين)българскиČeštinaDanskDeutsch (Schweiz)ΕλληνικάEnglish (UAE)English (Australia)English (Bahrain)English (India)English (Japan)English (Kazakhstan)English (Nigeria)English (New Zealand)English (South Africa)Español (España)Español (Argentina)Español (Latinoamérica)Español (México)FrançaisFrançais (Afrique)magyar nyelvBahasa IndonesiaItaliano日本語Қазақша (Қазақстан)Қазақшаລາວlatviešu valodaPolskiPortuguêsPortuguês (Brasil)RomânăРусскийРусский (Казахстан)Русский (Украина)සිංහලSlovenčinaSlovenščinaSvenskaTürkçeУкраїнськаTiếng Việt简体中文繁體中文USD-$USD-$AED-د.إARS-ARS$AUD-A$BDT-৳BGN-лвBHD-.د.بBOB-$bBRL-R$CAD-C$CHF-CHFCNY-¥COP-COL$CZK-KčDKK-KREGP-E£EUR-€GBP-£HKD-HKDHRK-knHUF-FtIDR-RpINR-₹JPY-¥KES-KShKWD-ك.دKZT-₸MAD-م.د.MNT-₮MXN-Mex$NZD-NZ$OMR-ر.ع.PEN-S/.PHP-₱PKR-₨PLN-złQAR-ر.قRON-leiRUB-₽SAR-ر.سSEK-krTHB-฿TRY-₺TWD-NT$UAH-₴UGX-UShVES-BsVND-₫ZAR-RThemeEnglishUSDThemeAbout UsAboutCareersAnnouncementsNewsPressLegalTermsPrivacyBuilding TrustBlogCommunitySitemapRisk WarningNoticesDownloadsDesktop ApplicationProductsExchangeBuy CryptoLeveraged TokensTradingViewPayAcademyLiveTaxGift CardLaunchpad & LaunchpoolAuto-InvestETH StakingNFTBNBBABTResearchCharityBusinessP2P Merchant ApplicationP2Pro Merchant ApplicationListing ApplicationInstitutional & VIP ServicesLabsLearnLearn & EarnBrowse Crypto PricesBitcoin PriceEthereum PriceBrowse Crypto Price PredictionsBitcoin Price PredictionEthereum Price PredictionBuy BitcoinBuy BNBBuy RippleBuy DogecoinBuy EthereumBuy Tradable AltcoinsServiceAffiliateReferralOTC TradingHistorical Market DataProof of ReservesSupport24/7 Chat SupportSupport CenterProduct Feedback & SuggestionsFeesAPIsBinance VerifyTrading RulesBinance Airdrop PortalLaw Enforcement RequestsBinance©2024Cookie PreferencesHacer clic para escuchar el sonido4:23Cookie PreferenceWelcome aboard the Binance spaceship!
